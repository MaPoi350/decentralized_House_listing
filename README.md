# Decentralized_House_listing

At present, property titles are often paper-based, creating opportunities for errors and fraud. Title professionals find defects in 25% of all titles during the transaction process, according to the American Land Title Association.
Any identified defect makes it illegal to transfer a property title to a buyer until it is rectified. This means property owners often incur high legal fees to ensure authenticity and accuracy of their property titles.
Moreover, title fraud poses a risk to homeowners worldwide. US losses associated with title fraud reportedly averaged around $103,000 per case in 2015, compelling many property buyers to purchase title insurance.

In this project we will be minting our own tokens (ERC-721) to represent titles to the properties. Before minting a token, we need to verify that we own the property. zk-SNARKs shall be used to create a verification system which can prove ownership of the title to the property without revealing that specific information on the property. The contract shall be deployed on the Rinkeby Testnet and the tokens/properties shall be listed on the testnet of opensea.
